Glamorous Toolkit Runner (for Windows)
======================================
The executable for [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/) resides in the `bin/` subdirectory, making it non-obvious to find for novices.

This minimal executable increases the chances that students find it: It's placed in the top-level folder, aside GT's `.image` file, and shows the official icon. And in case somebody tries to run GT from inside a ZIP archive, it warns to extract GT first.

Usage
=====
[Download GT](https://gtoolkit.com/download/), drop the here included `GlamorousToolkit.exe` into the archive and distribute that to students.

Optionally add your own content to GT, such as [Processing Abstractions](https://github.com/zeniko/processing-abstractions) (requires [GtExploration](https://github.com/zeniko/gt-exploration)).
